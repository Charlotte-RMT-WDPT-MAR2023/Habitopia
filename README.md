# Habitopia

In habit.model.js I've added a details field to the occurance section -  this would be e.g. distance for running, duration for yoga/meditation or volume for water drunk.

We can push to the occurance array when a habit is done


These sections below I haven't updated: Routes, Project, Trello and Slides
